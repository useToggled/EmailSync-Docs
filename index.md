# Welcome to EmailSync

EmailSync makes email verification ten times simpler for users and developers.

EmailSync allows you to link your IP to your email address so that any sites supporting our software can identify that you own that email address.

We also have built-in email verification in case the user hasn't already verified their email.

Verify your email now on the [homepage](https://anti-verification.cosmixcom.repl.co).

## Developers
Make sure to initiate the API before using parameters, actions, or checking emails.

```js
emailsync.init('YOUR_API_KEY')
```
